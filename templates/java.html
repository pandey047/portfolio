                    <p class="card-text">The Android software development kit (SDK) includes a comprehensive set of
                        development tools. The Android SDK Platform Tools are a separately downloadable subset of the
                        full SDK, consisting of command-line tools such as adb and fastboot. The Android Debug Bridge
                        (ADB) is a tool to run commands on a connected Android device. Fastboot is a protocol used for
                        flashing filesystems. Code written in C/C++ can be compiled to ARM, or x86 native code (or their
                        64-bit variants) using the Android Native Development Kit (NDK).</p>

                    <h5 class="card-title">Data Visualization Software</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">The presentation creation and visual representation of data in the graphical or
                        pictorial format are referred to as Data Visualization. Data Visualization has become an active
                        field of research & development by being closely related to information graphics and
                        visualization, statistical graphics and scientific visualization.

                        The project displays the node connectivity in networking in data visualization form. This node
                        connectivity can be located at different locations via mouse or trackpad.</p>
